# changeLogTypeScript
## Step 1: Verify Node.js Installation
Before proceeding, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check this by opening your terminal and running the following command:
   node -v
## Step 2: Install TypeScript
To work with TypeScript, you need to install it globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run the following command:
   npm install -g typescript
   
## Step 3: Create a TypeScript File
Create a TypeScript file named changeLog.ts containing your TypeScript code. You can use your preferred code editor or create it using a command-line text editor.

## Step 4: Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
To transpile the TypeScript file changeLog.ts into JavaScript, use the TypeScript compiler (tsc). Run the following command in your terminal:
  tsc changeLog.ts
  This command will generate a JavaScript file named changeLog.js.

## Step 5: Execute the JavaScript File
Now, you can run the generated JavaScript file using Node.js. Use the following command in your terminal:
  node changeLog.js
This command will execute the JavaScript file, allowing you to run the TypeScript code.
