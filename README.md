### Step 1: Verify Node.js Installation 
Before proceeding, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check this by opening your terminal and running the following command: <br />
   	**node -v**  
### Step 2: Install TypeScript
To work with TypeScript, you need to install it globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run the following command:<br />
   **npm install -g typescript** 
   
### Step 3: Create a TypeScript File
Create a TypeScript file named changeLog.ts containing your TypeScript code. You can use your preferred code editor or create it using a command-line text editor.

### Step 4: Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
To transpile the TypeScript file changeLog.ts into JavaScript, use the TypeScript compiler (tsc). Run the following command in your terminal:<br />
  **tsc changeLog.ts** <br />
This command will generate a JavaScript file named changeLog.js.

### Step 5: Execute the JavaScript File
Now, you can run the generated JavaScript file using Node.js. Use the following command in your terminal:<br />
  **node changeLog.js** <br />
This command will execute the JavaScript file, allowing you to run the TypeScript code.
